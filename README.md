# Phishing-detection-system-using-Clustering-technique

Phishing websites: Websites that attempt to trick users into revealing personal or financial information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, or bank accounts, by impersonating legitimate entities or organizations.

Machine learning: A branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and perform tasks without explicit programming or rules, such as classification, regression, clustering, or recommendation.

Statement of Problem: Existing phishing detection methods relying on static blacklists and rule-based approaches struggles to keep up with the dynamic tactics of cybercriminals leading to an increased vulnerability of evolving phishing attacks.
Therefore, there is a need to develop a robust phishing detection system incorporating machine learning, anomaly detection, and real-time analysis, hence this study.

Aim:
  The aim of this study is to develop a robust phishing website detection system to reduce user susceptibility to phishing attacks.

Objectives:
(I)  To gather datasets on phishing websites.
(II)  To design a Model for (I).
(III)  To develop a system for (II).
(IV)  To evaluate the performance.

TOOLS USED: 
In development of the system, several dependencies were utilized such as;
1. Streamlit, used in the creation of the user interactive interface, providing a simplified and user-friendly interactivity.
2. Numpy, an open-source library in python employed to support for large multidimensional arrays and matrices in the system.
3. Scikit-learn, a machine learning library in python, employed for the svm clustering, preprocessing operation and model selection, embedded in system development    for numerical computing.
4. PyMySQL, use of python programming language to interact with mysql database embedded for data analysis and automation.
